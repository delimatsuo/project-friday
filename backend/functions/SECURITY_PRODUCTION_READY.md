   - Suspicious activity detection and DDoS protection
   - Automatic cleanup and performance optimization

2. **Input Validation & Sanitization** (`src/utils/inputValidator.js`)
   - XSS protection with HTML entity encoding
   - SQL injection detection and blocking
   - Command injection prevention
   - Phone number E.164 validation
   - Webhook payload validation with signature verification

3. **Security Middleware** (`src/middleware/securityMiddleware.js`)
   - Helmet integration (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
   - CORS with allowlist-based origin validation
   - Request size limits (1MB) and API key authentication
   - Real-time security monitoring and logging

4. **API Key Management** (`src/services/apiKeyManager.js`)
   - Secure key generation and rotation
   - Plan-based permissions (free/developer/premium/enterprise)
   - Automatic expiration and usage tracking
   - Revocation capabilities with audit trails

5. **Audit Logging** (`src/services/auditLogger.js`)
   - Structured security event logging
   - Real-time threat detection and alerting
   - Performance metrics and compliance reporting
   - 90-day retention with automatic archiving

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **23 security tests** with London School TDD methodology
- **Artillery load testing** with attack simulations
- **Performance validation** (95% < 2s response time)
- **Security edge case testing** and integration validation

### Security Validation Results
```bash
# Run comprehensive security tests
npm run security:full

# Load testing with security focus
npm run load:security

# Vulnerability auditing
npm run security:audit
```

### Defense in Depth Layers
1. **Network**: CORS, security headers, request size limits
2. **Authentication**: API key validation with plan-based permissions
3. **Application**: Input sanitization, rate limiting, DDoS protection
4. **Data**: Hashing, sanitization, secure storage
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time logging, threat detection, alerting

## üîß Operations & Maintenance

### NPM Scripts for Security Operations
```bash
# Testing
npm run security:test          # Unit tests
npm run security:load          # Load testing  
npm run security:validate      # Full validation

# Monitoring
npm run security:audit         # Vulnerability scan
npm run validate:security      # Health check
```

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Real-time security events** via audit logger
- **Rate limiting statistics** and utilization metrics
- **API key usage tracking** and renewal alerts
- **Performance monitoring** with bottleneck detection

## üö® Incident Response

### Automated Security Responses
- **Malicious requests**: Immediate blocking with audit logging
- **Rate limit violations**: Progressive throttling and temporary blocks
- **Suspicious patterns**: Enhanced monitoring and security alerts
- **Critical events**: Real-time notification to security team

### Security Event Categories
- **HIGH**: Multiple failed auth attempts, SQL injection attempts
- **MEDIUM**: Rate limit violations, suspicious activity patterns  
- **LOW**: Normal security validations, routine monitoring events
- **CRITICAL**: DDoS attacks, data breach attempts, system compromises
