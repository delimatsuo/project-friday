## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth Strategy
```
Internet → CORS/Headers → Rate Limiting → API Authentication → 
Input Validation → Business Logic → Audit Logging → Firestore
```

### Core Security Components

#### 1. 🚦 **Rate Limiting Service** (`rateLimiter.js`)
- **Sliding window algorithm** with Firestore-backed persistence
- **Endpoint-specific limits**:
  - API endpoints: 100 requests/minute
  - Webhook endpoints: 10 requests/minute  
  - Authentication: 5 requests/15 minutes
  - AI processing: 20 requests/minute
- **DDoS protection** with suspicious activity detection
- **Automatic cleanup** and performance optimization

#### 2. 🛡️ **Security Middleware** (`securityMiddleware.js`)
- **Helmet integration** for comprehensive HTTP security headers
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **CORS configuration** with allowlist-based origin validation
- **Request size limits** (1MB maximum)
- **Real-time security monitoring** and threat detection

#### 3. ✅ **Input Validation & Sanitization** (`inputValidator.js`)
- **XSS protection** with HTML entity encoding
- **SQL injection detection** and blocking
- **Command injection** and path traversal prevention
- **Phone number validation** with E.164 format enforcement
- **Webhook payload validation** with Twilio signature verification

#### 4. 🔐 **API Key Management** (`apiKeyManager.js`)
- **Secure key generation** using `crypto.randomBytes`
- **Key rotation** with configurable grace periods
- **Plan-based permissions** (free/developer/premium/enterprise)
- **Automatic expiration handling** and usage tracking
- **Rate limit integration** per API key

#### 5. 📋 **Audit Logging** (`auditLogger.js`)
- **Structured security event logging** with severity levels
- **Real-time threat detection** and alerting
- **Performance metrics collection**
- **Compliance reporting** capabilities
- **90-day retention** with automatic archiving

## Security Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage: 🎯 100% (23/23 Tests Passing)

#### Unit Tests by Category:
- **Rate Limiting**: 4 tests (sliding window, burst protection, endpoint limits)
- **Input Validation**: 4 tests (XSS, SQL injection, phone validation, webhook)
- **Security Middleware**: 4 tests (headers, API keys, size limits, suspicious activity)
- **CORS & Headers**: 2 tests (origin validation, CSP configuration)
- **API Key Management**: 2 tests (validation, rotation)
- **Audit Logging**: 3 tests (failed auth, suspicious activity, security events)
- **Load Testing**: 2 tests (high load security, DDoS prevention)
- **Integration**: 2 tests (webhook security, edge cases)

### Load Testing Framework

#### Artillery-Based Security Testing:
- **Rate limiting validation** under high load
- **Attack simulation** (XSS, SQL injection attempts)
- **Performance validation** (95% < 2s, 99% < 5s response times)
- **Concurrent user simulation** up to 1000 users
- **DDoS resilience testing**
