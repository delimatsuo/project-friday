- Full stack now operational: Call screening → AI processing → Storage → Real-time UI → Push notifications
- Next task (12): Backend - Implement Call Action Notifications via FCM
- Project is 73% complete (11 of 15 tasks done)
- Consider end-to-end testing of entire call flow
- APNs configuration may need manual setup in Apple Developer portal
