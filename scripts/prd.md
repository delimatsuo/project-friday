# Product Requirements Document: Project Friday

**Version:** 1.1 (Detailed for Development)  
**Status:** Draft for Development Team  
**Target Release:** V1.0 - The Personal Assistant

# Overview

Project Friday is an iOS application that gives individuals back their time and peace of mind by intelligently managing their phone calls. The app uses a sophisticated AI assistant, powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash, to screen incoming calls on the user's behalf through a server-side architecture.

**Problem:** Busy professionals and focused individuals are constantly interrupted by unwanted calls, but they risk missing important calls from unknown numbers (doctor's office, new clients, emergencies).

**Solution:** An AI-powered call screening service that handles calls server-side via Twilio, using advanced conversation AI to determine call importance and provide intelligent summaries to users.

**Value:** Users reclaim their focus time while never missing truly important calls, with AI handling the screening process professionally and transparently.
